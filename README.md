# Raspberry Pi Control with pigpio

## Overview
This repository contains a sample program for outputting PWM (Pulse Width Modulation) signals using the GPIO pins of a Raspberry Pi. Utilizing the pigpio library, it generates PWM signals from specific pins to control external devices.

## Key Features
- Outputs PWM signals through GPIO pins.
- Sets PWM frequency and duty cycle to meet the control requirements of different devices.

## Requirements
- Any model of Raspberry Pi
- Raspbian OS or Raspberry Pi OS
- pigpio library

## Setup
1. Install and update Raspberry Pi OS to the latest version.
2. Install the pigpio library:
    ```bash
    sudo apt-get update
    sudo apt-get install pigpio python-pigpio python3-pigpio
    ```
3. Enable and start the pigpio daemon:
    ```bash
    sudo systemctl enable pigpiod
    sudo systemctl start pigpiod
    ```

## Usage
Before running the program, make sure the pigpio daemon is active. Then, use the following command to execute the script:

```bash
python raspberry_pi_pigpio_hw_pwm.py
```

## Program Files
- `raspberry_pi_pigpio_hw_pwm.py`: The main script file that manages the settings and output of PWM signals.
